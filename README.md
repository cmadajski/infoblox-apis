# Infoblox APIs

The purpose of this repo is to explore and document how the Infoblox Web API (WAPI) works. The content here is only covering the RESTful WAPI; the legacy Perl API (PAPI) is not covered here.

In my opinion, the Infoblox WAPI is extremely difficult to get started with. There is public documentation available for the Infoblox WAPI, but it's the autogenerated variety that doesn't really provide an adequate explanantion of how to send API calls (especially for raw beginners). Most of what I know has been discovered by screwing around in a mature Infoblox environment and reverse-engineering (sometimes brute-forcing) API calls. I've wasted a bazillion hours on this process and hopefully I can save you from this merry-go-round of insanity.
